# DiSEG-X
DiSEG-X: Enhancing Vision-Language Understanding with Dino-X powered models

# Abstract
will be updated after publication (to avoid similarity)

# Overview
1) In this work, we propose a framework that integrates hierarchical reasoning with adaptive cross-modal processing.
2) Performance across spatial resolutions to validate generalizability in remote sensing applications has been evaluated, which provided a suitable range of spatial resolution for effective segmentation.
3)  Two major remote sensing applications involving land use and land cover analysis and individual tree detection were explored.
4)  The selected datasets cover regions with diverse landscapes to test model effectiveness across heterogeneous spatial contexts.
5)  Suggested DINO-X-based models outperform established models by noticeable margins.

# Installation Guide
1. Create the Conda environment

conda env create -f diseg_x.yml

conda activate diseg_x

2. Run diseg_x.ipynb file using environment tfclone
